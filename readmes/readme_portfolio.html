    <h1 class="main-title">August Ollé's portfolio project</h1>
    <h2 class="title">1. Objectives</h2>
    <p class="section">The main objective set for this project was building a well structured online portfolio, covering the next goals:
        <ul class="section goals">
            <li>Clear and correct HTML and CSS structure,</li>
            <li>Neat, balanced, design,</li>
            <li>Implementing skills using tendencies such as parallax and SVG animation,</li>
            <li>Giving some contact options via social media, email or a contact form.</li>
            <li>Easy, ellegant functionality.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">2. Design</h2>
    <p class="section">Four keywords were set as guidelines for the web design: <b>clearness</b>, <b>originality</b>, <b>appeal</b> and <b>comfort</b>. I started with the practical idea of <b>depth</b> and <b>floating elements</b> in a 3d space as an starting point for the design of the site.</p>
        <div class="palette">
        <h3 class="subtitle">Color palette</h3>
        <div class="palette__colour colour1"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour2"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour3"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour4"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="section">I picked an analogous harmony palette based on blue tones. Blue is known to convey an idea of stability and reliability. I wanted the site to be colorful and appealing but still easy for the sight.<br> This palette is kept along the site to mantain concordance. I chose a greyish blue as an accent colour, mainly in buttons.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Typography</h3>
    <p class="section">Following the initial idea of clearness and comfort, only one font family is used, and it is '<b>Motserrat</b>', because of its round, wide, traces. They add high readability while looking modern and appealing.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Layout</h3>
    <p class="section">The page design has a simple layout with a common, neat header, with a logo and a menu icon('burguer') on mobile devices. The menu is visible, fixed on the header, when seen on desktop screens. Tags and text boxes have round corners and are centered to leave free space on both sides on computer screens.</p>
     <h2 class="title">3. Main features</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Sections</h3>
    <p class="section">The site has a main page and the two following sections:
        <ul class="section goals">
            <li><b>Projects</b>, where the user can have an overview of different projects I completed and have access to navigate the project or visit a report (another HTML page) that resumes some of the highlights of the projects and ideas for further versions.</li>
            <li><b>Contact</b>, with a contact form where the user can leave a message, that will be sent by email when submitted.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Responsive Design</h3>
    <p class="section">The web is fully responsive. The design is made to keep the idea of space and depth on all screens. I used <b>media queries</b> at 1000px and 1400px-wide screens, <b>flexbox and grid</b> are used in CSS to reach this goal.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Javascript functionalities</h3>
    <p class="section">On the main page, there is a parallax efect landscape with some hot air balloons raising to the sky. There is a readable message in words that move in the 3d space created with the parallax effect.<br>
                        Just under the parallax section, there are <b>two animated SVG</b>, displaying my name and the words 'web development'. They show up as the user scrolls down the page. They emphasize my name and role, while giving some dynamics to the page.<br>
                        In the Contact page, there is a contact form with an <b>effect on the labels</b> of each input. They are animated using CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">4. Future improvements</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle">3D environment</h3>
    <p class="section">I am working on another section under the parallax effect with a 3d environment inserted on the website, via three.js library for Javascript.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">New 'about me' section.</h3>
    <p class="section">I plan to include this section, explaining my experience and interests around web and coding subjects.<br>
                        Another possible section to include is a blog where I could upload my last learnings or technical articles about web development.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">More projects to show</h3>
    <p class="section">I am currently working on other projects to add to the gallery. These include a product page, a restaurant ordering interface and a task-manager.</p>
