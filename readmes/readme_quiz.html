    <h1 class="main-title">General Knowledge quiz</h1>
    <h2 class="title">1. Objectives</h2>
    <p class="section">The main objective set for this project was building a well structured online portfolio, covering the next goals:
        <ul class="section goals">
            <li>Clear and correct HTML and CSS structure,</li>
            <li>Neat, balanced, design,</li>
            <li>Showing some skills using tendencies such as parallax and SVG animation,</li>
            <li>Giving some contact options via social media, email or a contact form.</li>
            <li>Full, easy functionality.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">2. Design</h2>
    <p class="section">Four keywords were set as guidelines for the web design: <b>clearness</b>, <b>originality</b>, <b>appeal</b> and <b>comfort</b>. I started with the practical idea of <b>depth</b> and <b>floating elements</b> in a 3d space as an starting point for the design of the site.</p>
        <div class="palette">
        <h3 class="subsection">Color palette</h3>
        <div class="palette__colour colour1"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour2"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour3"></div>
        <div class="palette__colour colour4"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="section">I choosed a purple-blue (#6d6dc7) as main color. Blue is known to transmit an idea of stability, reliability, while purple evoques calmness. I wanted the site to be colorful and appealing but still easy for the sight. The gradient on the background helps creating an illusion of depth in the main page, along with the parallax effect.<br> For the hole site, an analogous color palette is used, to evoque the sense of concordance along the site. I chose just a light blue as an accent colour in buttons.</p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Typography</h3>
    <p class="section">Following the initial idea of clearness and comfort, only one font family is used, and it is '<b>Motserrat</b>', because of its round, wide, traces. They add high readability while looking modern and appealing.</p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Layout</h3>
    <p class="section">The page design has a simple layout with a common, neat header, with a logo and a menu icon('burguer') on mobile devices. The menu is visible, fixed on the header, when seen on desktop screens. Tags and text boxes have round corners and are centered, leaving free space on both sides on computer screens.</p>
     <h2 class="title">3. Main features</h2>
    <h3 class="subsection">Sections</h3>
    <p class="section">The site has a main page and the three following sections:
        <ul class="section goals">
            <li><b>Projects</b>, where the user can have an overview of different projects I completed and have access to navigate the project or visit a report (another HTML page) that resumes some of the highlights of the projects and ideas for further versions.</li>
            <li><b>About</b>, with some general information about me and my work.</li>
            <li><b>Contact</b>, with a contact form where the user can leave a message, that will be sent by email when submitted.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Responsive Design</h3>
    <p class="section">The web is fully responsive. The design is made to keep the idea of space and depth on all screens. Media queries, flexbox and grid are used in css to reach this goal.</p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Parallax</h3>
    <p class="section">On the main page, there are some 3d icons related to web development floating in 3 different layers. Elements on each layer have a different blur filter and size, so they contribute to the illusion of depth.</p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Animated SVG</h3>
    <p class="section">Embedded in the parallax section, there is an animated SVG, displaying my name and the words 'web development'. They show as the user scrolls down the page.</p>
    <h2 class="title">4. Future improvements</h2>
    <h3 class="subsection">Parallax implementation on all sections.</h3>
    <p class="section">In order to reinforce the sense of continuity in the design along the web. The background where all the web elements float would show some of the 3d icons as in the main page, moving across when scrolling down the page.</p>
    <h3 class="subsection">More projects to show</h3>
    <p class="section">I am currently working in other projects to add to the gallery. These include a product page, a restaurant ordering interface and a task-manager.</p>
